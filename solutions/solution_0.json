{"problem": "1.1.11 - Hubble's law", "book": "Mathematical Methods for Physicists", "solution": "Hubble's law implies\r\n\r\n$$\\mathbf{v}_1 = H_0 \\, \\mathbf{r}_1$$\r\n\r\nfor the galaxy at $\\mathbf{r}_1$.  Subtracting this from the general law, we have\r\n\r\n$$\\mathbf{v}_i - \\mathbf{v}_1 = H_0 (\\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{r}_1)$$\r\n\r\nNow we define the distance to galaxies in a new coordinate system, in which the galaxy at $\\mathbf{r}_1$ lies at the origin.  Thus, we define the transformation\r\n\r\n$$\\mathbf{r}_i' = \\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{r}_1$$\r\n\r\nDifferentiating with respect to time, we obtain the corresponding transformation for galactic velocities:\r\n\r\n$$\\mathbf{v}_i' = \\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\mathbf{r}_i}{\\mathrm{d} t} = \\mathbf{v}_i - \\mathbf{v}_1$$\r\n\r\nSubstituting, we may therefore write, in the new coordinate system,\r\n\r\n$$\\mathbf{v}_i' = H_0 \\, \\mathbf{r}_i'$$\r\n", "statement": "Hubble found that distant galaxies are receding with a velocity proportional to their distance from where we are on Earth.  For the $i$th galaxy,\r\n\r\n$$\\mathbf{v}_i = H_0 \\, \\mathbf{r}_i$$\r\n\r\nwith us at the origin.  Show that this recession of the galaxies from us does <b>not</b> imply that we are at the center of the universe.  Specifically, take the galaxy at $\\mathbf{r}_1$ as a new origin and show that Hubble's law is still obeyed.\r\n", "author": "Arfken & Weber"}
