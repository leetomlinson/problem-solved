Take the first rocket path to be $\\mathbf{r}=\\mathbf{r}_1+t_1\\mathbf{v}_1$ with launch at $\\mathbf{r}_1=(1,1,1)$ and velocity $\\mathbf{v}_1=(1,2,3)$ and the second rocket path as $\\mathbf{r}=\\mathbf{r}_2+t_2\\mathbf{v}_2$ with $\\mathbf{r}_2=(5,2,1)$ and $\\mathbf{v}_2=(-1,-1,1)$.  Lengths are in kilometres, velocities in kilometres per hour.", "author": "Arfken & Weber"}
